# Cheetah-Learns-to-Run-using-RL-DDPG-algorighm
I trained a cat-like model to stand up and run forward all by itself using DDPG for the continuous action space.

After 200 episodes, the cat runs quite well and efficiently.
Here is a GIF example after training:

Since the cat is rewarded for moving forward and moving fast, it learns its own optimal method for running.
